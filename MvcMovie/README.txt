Step 1:

Create a web app using ASP.NET Core MVC and Visual Studio

Problem: 

The creating the account and setting up was bit hard at first and then I was able to follow the document.

Solution:

The document was the big bonus for us again, every micro details was important, so small small codes or data are important and after following that i was able to create it successfully.

Step 2:

Add a controller to an ASP.NET Core MVC application.

Problems:
How to name the controller class and the methods inside it?
How to use the scaffolding feature to generate a controller template?


Solution**:

The controllers was able to add by following the instructions.
I was able to use scaffolding feature only after i stopped the running output.

Step 3:

Create a view for the Index action method of the HelloWorldController class that displays a welcome message and the current date and time.

Problems:
How to create a view file and associate it with a controller action method?
How to use Razor syntax to write dynamic HTML code in the view file?
How to pass data from the controller to the view?

Solutions:

1. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the Views folder and select Add > New Folder. Name the folder HelloWorld.
2. Right-click on the HelloWorld folder and select Add > New Item.
3. In the Add New Item dialog, select Show All Templates.
4. In the search box in the upper-right corner, enter view.
5. Select Razor View - Empty and keep the default name Index.cshtml.
6. Replace the contents of the Views/HelloWorld/Index.cshtml

Step 4:

Add a model to an ASP.NET Core MVC app

Challenges:

In this tutorial, classes are added for managing movies in a database. These classes are the "Model" part of the MVC app.
These model classes are used with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to work with a database. EF Core is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies the data access code that you have to write.
The model classes created are known as POCO classes, from Plain Old CLR Objects. POCO classes don't have any dependency on EF Core. They only define the properties of the data to be stored in the database.
In this tutorial, model classes are created first, and EF Core creates the database.

Solution:

The Builder file was running few erros, but i removed all data and again typed all from 
doc so that it runs properlly.

Step 5:

Work with a database in an ASP.NET Core MVC app

Challenges:

The main task was the table of movies.

Solution:

The program.cs file had the minor changes so I went to doc and read every line, and managed
to rewrite the code and all.

Finally Hurray it worked.

Step 6:

Challenges:

The edit and details and delete was new task to get the urls on the bottom left.
We were able to bring them. also the data in not in correct spacing format.

Solution:

The proper codes like:

using System;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

Have slight changes and made them work at the end.

Eveything is linked to the program.cs file so again made the changes there and got the
correct output.

Migrations:

Step 7:

CHALLENGES:

i was able to work on search command but initially i was not able to run it.

Solution:

The solution information given in the document mentioned that you might not get the output untill you have done the 
next step.
so going to do the step 8.

And even the time constrains as playing a major role.

Step 8:

challenges:

creating a new field R was coming errors.

solution:


Navigated to the relevant model class within the project and again went through whole code.
line by line i crosschecked and made sure there are no errors.
again build it and after running i was able to see the output (R).

Step 9:

Add validation to an ASP.NET Core MVC app

comments:

This step was actually very much complex codes but initially as i mentioned early what i learned was to build the program
after every step you do.
And even if you are doing any changes make sure to close the output webpage.
Executed the migration to update the database with the new field.
Was able to run create page.
But cloning to git was having few errors.

additional comments:

the internet is buffering as i run the program. but made sure that the file is saved in every step. after some time i 
was able to see the output.

Step 10

I see that this step is to examine our program files and all the codes.

Learned to push all the commits to the GIT and was able to puch successfully.

comments:

Few things i found interesting was, firstly i was able to complete the lab and was happy to have my webpage yet it is
on the local host.

The journey of these 4 weeks was amazing, having errors, learning new things all the time, learned about ASP.net and GIT.

I know that this is lab is initial stage, waiting to do more wonders with this visual studios.
